9PatchMaker
===========

Simple Python script for making 9 patch files intended for centered splash screens. Generates resources in various sizes in the same file structure as you'd expect for your app. 

To get started: Install Imagemagick and PythonMagick. Then just run it at the command line with the path to the png file it should process.

No pngs are harmed in the creation of these 9 patch files.
